# Convex Merger
This is an area maximisation game based on the idea of merging convex shapes.

### Task Assignment
Given the feedback we've decided to switch our main algorithm from a convex hull computation algorithm to a vertical decomposition computation algorithm. Hence the new ask distribution is as follows:
- Emiliyan: Vertical Decompositon
- Thiam-Wai: Playfield generation
- Roan: General game logic (everything without a comment mentioning an assignee)

### Development
This is an [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) + [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) project. Development work can be done using the Eclipse IDE (already setup) or using any other Gradle compatible IDE (manual setup). CI will check that all source files use Unix style line endings (LF) and that all functions and fields have valid documentation. Compiled binaries can be downloaded from the [CI/CD pipelines tab](https://gitlab.com/RoanH/convexmerger/-/pipelines).

# Convex Merger
This is an area maximisation game based on the idea of merging convex shapes.

### Task Assignment
Given the feedback we've decided to switch our main algorithm from a convex hull computation algorithm to a vertical decomposition computation algorithm. Hence the new ask distribution is as follows:
- Emiliyan: Vertical Decompositon
- Thiam-Wai: Playfield generation
- Roan: General game logic (everything without a comment mentioning an assignee)

### Development
This is an [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) + [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) project. Development work can be done using the Eclipse IDE (already setup) or using any other Gradle compatible IDE (manual setup).

## History
Project development started: 20th of November, 2021.
Project due date: 30th of January, 2022.

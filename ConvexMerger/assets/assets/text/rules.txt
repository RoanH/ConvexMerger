The goal of the game is to maximise the area of the playfield you own by claiming and merging objects into new convex objects. In every turn you can do the following:
Click an unowned object to claim it for yourself.
Click an object you already own and then select a second object either owned by you or unowned. If there are no objects on what will become the boundary of the new convex object the merge will succeed. Objects fully contained in the newly created convex object will be stolen from their current owner.
The game ends when the players whose turn it is has no possible moves available.
